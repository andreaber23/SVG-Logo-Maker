## Installation
First, install "npm inquirer". To do that, Open the integrated terminal of the file where you will be working on. Then, type "npm init". Once something is prompted, click enter until you are done with the prompts. After that, type "npm i inquirer@8.2.4". Make sure you are installing the most compatible version. 

Then for testing purposes, you have to install "jest". In the same terminal, type "npm install jest". To be able to see a preview of the logo, please install this extension on VS CODE (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jock.svg) Both things are mandatory for this project, so please make sure it is installed properly. 

## Usage
To run the log maker, open the integrated termianl in the "index.js" file. Once in there type "node index.js". User will be prompted with a couple of questions about the logo that they want to create such as shape, text color, shape color, and the 3 characters that they want to include in the logo. Once that is done, a file will be created with the name "logo.svg". Then, open it in the extension you installed earlier.
